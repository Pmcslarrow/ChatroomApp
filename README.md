# ChatroomApp

    This project was a way to learn about React.js as well as Socket.io to create a chatroom that allows for multiple users to communicate effectively. 
    The core functionality seemingly works properly, and I am wanting to add a login system that shows usernames as they are typed soon.
    

### Next Steps:

    # 1) User login page that then connects to the main page.
